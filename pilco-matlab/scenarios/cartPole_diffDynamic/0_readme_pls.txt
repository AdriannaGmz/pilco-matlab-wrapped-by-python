In this folder, the idea is to learn from a Dynamic Model with certain sets (specified in the settings_cp_forPython.m) and take that learning to another Dynamic Model with different parameters (maybe the weight of the pendulum or the lenght)

the idea is to transfer the learning from a model with certain dyns into another with different dyns using the adjustment proposed in the Higuera-Dudek 2017 paper

At this point, both systems should be proposed in Matlab and I must find the way in which the learning happens in a model and the implementation happens in another   (all matlab things)

In this folder, the idea is to learn NOT from the matlab Dynamic Model specified in the settings_cp_forPython.m, but to interact directly with the Dynamic Model of OpenAI gym, which provides the environment at a certain timestep.

The key idea is to succeed in this connection and see the learning

to manage the connection from matlab into providing commands at a certain time step so they are fed in the environment (generated in python, OpenAI gym runs in python).











#### FUTURE

As another stage, would be the transfer of learning:

I dont know the dynamics of Open AI and obviously it will be different from the one that will be learnt in Matlab. 

the idea would be to learn from a Dynamic Model (specified in the settings_cp_forPython.m) and take that learning to the Dynamic Model of OpenAI gym, which provides the environment.

*although that would be a plus bc obviously both systems have different dyns
